# Multi-Agent System (MAS) Patterns in Banking Applications

## Introduction

This document outlines common patterns used in multi-agent systems (MAS), particularly within the context of banking applications.  Multi-agent systems involve multiple autonomous agents interacting to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for individual agents to handle. These patterns provide architectural blueprints for designing and implementing effective MAS solutions.

## Agentic Workflow Patterns

Based on the provided image, the following patterns are detailed below:

### 1. Network (or Horizontal)

#### Description
In a network pattern, agents are interconnected and communicate with each other to achieve a common goal.  Agents within the network can have varying roles and responsibilities, forming a decentralized problem-solving structure.

#### Advantages
*   **Robustness:** The system is resilient to failures since multiple agents can perform similar tasks.
*   **Flexibility:** Agents can dynamically adapt to changes in the environment or requirements.
*   **Scalability:**  New agents can be added to the network to handle increased workload or complexity.

#### Disadvantages
*   **Complexity:** Managing communication and coordination between agents can be challenging.
*   **Potential for Conflicts:** Agents may have conflicting goals or actions, requiring conflict resolution mechanisms.
*   **Security Risks:** Inter-agent communication channels can be vulnerable and need proper security measures

#### Challenges and Solutions
*   **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent knowledge across the network.
    *   **Solution:** Implement knowledge-sharing protocols and synchronization mechanisms.
*   **Challenge:** Avoiding communication bottlenecks.
    *   **Solution:** Distribute communication load and optimize network topology.
*    **Challenge:** Ensuring the security of inter-agent communication
    *   **Solution:** Implement encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms for communication channels.

#### Banking Use Cases & Examples
*   **Fraud Detection:** A network of agents can monitor transactions, customer behavior, and external data sources. If one agent detects a suspicious pattern, it alerts other agents in the network to collaboratively investigate and verify the potential fraud.
*   **Customer Service:**  A network of chatbot agents handle customer inquiries. If one agent cannot resolve a query, it can escalate to a specialized agent or transfer the customer to a human representative.
*   **Loan Application Processing:** A network of agents can be responsible for different parts of the loan application process, such as credit check, document verification, and risk assessment.

### 2. Hierarchical (or Vertical)

#### Description
In a hierarchical pattern, agents are organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.  Higher-level agents manage and coordinate the activities of lower-level agents.

*   **Inflexibility:** Difficult to adapt to changing requirements or unexpected events.

#### Challenges and Solutions
*   **Challenge:** Bottlenecks at specific agents in the sequence.
    *   **Solution:** Optimize the performance of those agents or parallelize tasks where possible.
*   **Challenge:** Handling failures of agents in the sequence.
    *   **Solution:** Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms, such as retrying failed tasks or routing to a backup agent.

#### Banking Use Cases & Examples
*   **Transaction Processing:** A sequence of agents can be used to process transactions, with each agent performing a specific step, such as authentication, authorization, and settlement.
*   **Account Opening:** A series of agents handle the steps from initial application, verification, and account creation.
*   **KYC (Know Your Customer) Process:** Agents handle the steps of identification, verification, and risk assessment in a sequential manner.

### 4. Parallel

#### Description
In a parallel pattern, multiple agents perform tasks concurrently. The results from these agents are then combined or aggregated.

#### Advantages
*   **Speed:** Tasks are completed faster since they are performed in parallel.
*   **Efficiency:** Resources are utilized more efficiently.

#### Disadvantages
*   **Complexity:** Coordinating and synchronizing the activities of multiple agents can be challenging.
