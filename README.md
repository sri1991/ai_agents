## Agentic Workflow Patterns

### 1. Network (or Horizontal)

#### Description
In a network pattern, agents are interconnected and communicate with each other to achieve a common goal. Agents within the network can have varying roles and responsibilities, forming a decentralized problem-solving structure.

#### Advantages
*   **Robustness:** The system is resilient to failures since multiple agents can perform similar tasks.
*   **Flexibility:** Agents can dynamically adapt to changes in the environment or requirements.
*   **Scalability:** New agents can be added to the network to handle increased workload or complexity.

#### Disadvantages
*   **Complexity:** Managing communication and coordination between agents can be challenging.
*   **Potential for Conflicts:** Agents may have conflicting goals or actions, requiring conflict resolution mechanisms.
*   **Security Risks:** Inter-agent communication channels can be vulnerable and need proper security measures

#### Challenges and Solutions
*   **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent knowledge across the network.
    *   **Solution:** Implement knowledge-sharing protocols and synchronization mechanisms.
*   **Challenge:** Avoiding communication bottlenecks.
    *   **Solution:** Distribute communication load and optimize network topology.

*   **Inflexibility:** Difficult to adapt to changing requirements or unexpected events.

#### Challenges and Solutions
*   **Challenge:** Bottlenecks at specific agents in the sequence.
    *   **Solution:** Optimize the performance of those agents or parallelize tasks where possible.
